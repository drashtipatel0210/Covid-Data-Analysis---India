# 🦠 COVID-19 India Analysis

This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 and vaccination trends across India using real-world datasets. It includes detailed exploration of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination statistics across various Indian states.

---

## 📌 Objective

To perform an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 and vaccination data in India to uncover meaningful insights and trends using Python and visualization tools.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment  

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

- [`covid_19_india.csv`](#) – Confirmed, recovered, and death cases across Indian states  
- [`covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`](#) – Vaccination records across states (male/female distribution, totals, etc.)

(*Datasets originally sourced from public repositories like Kaggle or Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India*)

---

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

- Time-series analysis of COVID-19 confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths  
- Visualization of the most affected Indian states  
- Statewise comparison of active vs recovered cases  
- Gender distribution in vaccination  
- Identification of top 10 states by:
  - Active cases
  - Total deaths
  - Vaccination counts

---

## 📌 Insights Derived

- Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka consistently had the highest active and total case counts  
- Vaccination coverage varied significantly across states, with a visible impact on recovery rates  
- Female vaccination lagged slightly behind male vaccination in several regions  
- Peak periods of infection correlated with phases of national/state lockdowns

---

## 📚 Learnings

- Hands-on experience with real-world, messy datasets  
- Improved skills in data wrangling, merging, and time-series grouping  
- Strengthened ability to derive and communicate insights using data storytelling and visualizations

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Integrate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) for case prediction  
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash or Streamlit  
- Include district-level granularity if data is available
